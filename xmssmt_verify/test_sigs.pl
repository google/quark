# test_sigs.pl - automated signature verification batch script
#
#   This script scans <$dir> to find a list of all  public key files
#   (<@files>) and then uses that to search for corresponding signature files
#   (generated using the gensigs.pl script) (<@sigFiles>).  It then attempts
#   to verify the generated signatures and tracks the resulting pass/fail
#   stats that it prints onscreen at completion.
#
#   Public key files are identified by their file name formats which are
#   expected to be of the form:
#
#        hss_<h0>.<w0>[_<hi>.<wi>]*.pub
#
#   where there can be 0 to 7 _<hi>.<wi> terms depending on
#   the L value (0 for L = 1, 7 for L = 8).
#
#   The corresponding signature files are identified by their file name formats
#   which are expected to be of the form:
#
#        hss_<h0>.<w0>[_<hi>.<wi>]*_<#>.sig
#
#   where <#> is an integer value ranging from 0 onwards (dictated by the
#   <$numSigs> parameter in gensigs.pl).
#
#   The signed file is identified by its file name format which is expected
#   to be f the form:
#
#        hss_<h0>.<w0>[_<hi>.<wi>]*
#
#   The verification primitive is specified via <$hssVerify>.
